# telecom-upselling-system
A machine learning–based telecom sales enhancement system that analyzes customer behavior to recommend personalized package upgrades and improve retention.
# 📈 Telecom Upselling System

A data-driven **sales enhancement system** for telecom companies that analyzes customer usage patterns to **recommend personalized packages** and boost overall revenue.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The system leverages **machine learning and MLOps** techniques to identify customer segments and predict upgrade opportunities.  
By studying customer behavior, it enables telecom companies to **offer customized packages**, reduce churn, and optimize sales strategies.

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The project is designed as a **hybrid ML system** combining multiple components:

- 🧩 **Clustering** – to segment customers based on behavior and usage.
- ⚡ **XGBoost Model** – for predicting upgrade likelihood.
- 📊 **VAR Model** – to forecast customer engagement trends.
- 🛠️ **MLOps Pipeline** – for continuous integration, training, and deployment of models.

---

## 💡 Key Challenges Addressed

- **Data Bias** — due to a high number of low-consumption users.  
- **Cold Start Problem** — handling new customers with limited data.  
- **Data Quality** — improving low-quality or incomplete telecom records.
